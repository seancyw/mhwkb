## Warning About Discontinuing Medication
Please note: doctors recommend that no one should attempt to withdrawal
from psychiatric drugs (Antidepressants, Antipsychotics, Anti-anxiety drugs
and ADHD drugs) without a doctor's supervision. If you have firmly decided to
discontinue medication without a doctor's supervision, you may find some guides
to medication on Amazon or other book-selling sites.

## About Me
I first received treatment for mental health issues (major depression, anxiety,
PTSD) in 1991 (age 18). As a patient, I have seen numerous psychiatrists and
psychotherapists, and have been prescribed (and used) many types of psychiatric
medication. I have read many opinions on the subject of mental health, and the
negative and positive experiences consumers have had while using the mental
health care system. I have also read information written by journalists and
doctors. I have no formal education in biology, medicine, psychiatry, or
psychology.
